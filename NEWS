Version 3
---------

Released: 2021-01-05

- Use the new git repository location at gitlab.com.
- Upgrade to Debian 10 (Buster) and Fedora 33.

- Fix the git-bash-prompt.
- Allocate more space (25G) for root partition, for GUB build.

Version 1
---------

Released: 2019-12-04

Changes:

- Auto-resize and Guest Additions in Virtualbox will now work, as the images
  contain virtualbox-guest-* packages.
- Applications which require root privileges, such as Synaptics, can now
  be started without errors.
- Add a few packages recommended for LilyPond development: openssh, tidy.
- Add GUB repository and packages needed to crosscompile LilyPond (but GUB
  builds have not been thoroughly tested).
- Fix message error "Unable to resolv host lilydev".


Version 0.3
-----------

Released: 2018-12-12

Changes:

- New Docker container based on Ubuntu 18.04: download this repository and
  follow the instructions in `docker/`.
- The images uploaded in Releases are based on Debian 9 Stretch.
  (Fedora images, upgraded to version 29, can still be generated
  using the Makefile)
- The Debian virtual machine is now using the XFCE desktop environment.
- Debian images have all the dependencies to run GUB.


Version 0.2
-----------

Released: 2017-10-30

Changes:

- Added a Debian container, based on stretch.
- Fedora images upgraded to version 27.
- Added all dependencies needed to build LilyPond without
  any warning: extractpdfmark, URW-35 OpenType font
  files (thanks to @karlinhigh).
- GUI apps can now be run from the container out of the
  box. This is based on a couple of assumptions, which
  should be correct most of the times (see the README).


Version 0.1
-----------

Released: 2017-07-14

This is the first version of LilyDev built using mkosi.
The images are based on Fedora 26.
